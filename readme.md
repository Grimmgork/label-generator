# LABEL GENERATOR

this simple tool will generate labels based on csv data.
It takes a table of data from wich each row corresponds to a label.
In the HTML template, you define where the values of the row should be inserted.
The resulting html page just stacks all labels with inserted values horizontally.
This page can then simply be printed to paper and cut out :)

Ideal for:
- Business-Cards
- Labels with QR-Codes

try the example template:
```
./label.ps1 ./example/label.html ./example/names.csv > ./result.html
```

then open the ./result.html in the browser

## custom template syntax:

the template describes the html-snippets wich get placed by each iteration.

a minimal template looks like this:
```
#label
<h1>$#data#$</h1>
<h2>iteration: $#COUNT#$</h2>

#root
<style>
h1 {
  color: blue;
  font-family: monospace;
}
</style>
```
the file is split into two sections: ```#label``` and ```#root```:

```#label``` contains html wich gets inserted each iteration.

```#root``` is inserted once into the final document. This is the ideal place for css styling or javascript for initialization.

```$#data#$``` is where the data from the input dataset is inserted. In this example the value from the column ```data``` is inserted.

```$#COUNT#$``` is generated by the tool and is a placeholder for the current iteration number.
